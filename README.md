# AI-Powered RAG Application for Automated Dividend Data Extraction

This project is an end-to-end **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** based application designed to automate the extraction of **dividend-related information** from large Business Development Company (BDC) PDF reports.  

Financial analysts previously had to manually read through lengthy documents to extract dividend data â€” a time-consuming and error-prone process. This solution automates the workflow, enabling instant access to structured insights with high accuracy.

## Project Overview

The system ingests PDF reports, processes and indexes the content, and enables users to query dividend-related information using natural language. The application uses a hybrid RAG architecture with vector search + LLM reasoning to extract precise and context-aware responses.

### **Key Outcomes**
- Fully automated extraction of dividend information from BDC PDF reports
- Reduced manual effort and analyst workload to near-zero
- Faster data access with higher accuracy and consistency
- Converts unstructured PDFs into structured, query-ready data
